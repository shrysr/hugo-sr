## Me {#me}

I'm Shreyas (_sh(ray)-us_) Ragavan.

My passions typically revolve around severely flexing my creative and analytical
muscles in finding multi-disciplinary solutions to problems. I enjoy trying to
figure out how things work. I'm a dreamer and a [hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).

I started my career as a mechanical engineer and computational physicist and my
favorite subjects were Combustion, Aerodynamics and particularly Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD); and applying these subjects in the areas of design
engineering. CFD incidentally has a number of aspects that are closely aligned
with many aspects important to Data Science ([or whatever that is](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734))

Over time, my interests .. mutated and diversified or gained a certain focus
depending on your point of view.

My current areas of fascination lie in the applications of Data
Science/Engineering and Machine Learning which tie in with my drive for using
'computers' in a sophisticated manner to 'model things' and create 'something
useful'.

Along the way, I've worked in R&amp;D, Manufacturing, Operations Research, Sales and
in Software Engineering. A few years ago, I took a leap of faith, from Mumbai,
India and landed on the East Coast, in Toronto (Canada) and then made my way
over to the other end, near Vancouver, British Columbia.

My hobbies tend to lie in the directions of reading, writing and drawing, and of
course - the eternal quest to become a better programmer and building something
_cool_, if not useful. Nowadays, I'm also trying to 'live more', by experimenting
with 'interesting things' that exist outside a computer :)

I also love using [Emacs](<https://www.emacswiki.org>)! and am currently one of
the many Admins for the [EmacsWiki](<https://www.emacswiki.org>).

## This website {#this-website}

This is a static website built using Hugo. The [source](https://github.com/shrysr/hugo-sr) is available on a git repo.

Currently, this site uses the [Hugo Zen theme](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen), which I am modifying to make 'my
own'. The earlier theme was a modified version of a much older version of the
Hugo Academic theme. The main reason was to progressively reduce 'bloat' and
focus on content while also using a codebase that was simpler and more
approachable.

I am just another hacker (_both in skills and spirit_), and not any kind of expert
in web design. Constructive feedback is always welcome.


## Social Media {#social-media}

The only social media platform that I am active on, is Linked in, where I've
included a fairly detailed chronological work history and also have a few
commendations from people I've worked with.

I do have accounts on Mastodon and Twitter (and perhaps others that I've
forgotten about), but I never seem to find the inclination to look at them
much. I also tend to hang out around #emacs and other channels on the Libera
network (IRC).
