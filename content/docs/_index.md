## Tools / Methodology:

The above is maintained entirely with Org mode documents. Using the excellent [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/ "ox-hugo library for Emacs") library, the content is maintained in a mixture of stand-alone documents or sub-headings within larger topics. A lot of the content is now managed using the [org brain](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain "org brain on github") package.

## Navigation

Use the navigation bar on the left / right to jump to articles or sections and the  search bar to find specific keywords.
