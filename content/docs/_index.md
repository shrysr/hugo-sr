# My evolving Brain dump !
This Documentation section contains :

 - notes,
 - quotes,
 - summaries,
 - tutorials,
 - project documentation
 - code snippets

# Tools / Methodology:

The above is maintained entirely with Org mode documents. Using the excellent [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/ "ox-hugo library for Emacs") library, the content is maintained in a mixture of stand-alone documents or sub-headings within larger topics.
