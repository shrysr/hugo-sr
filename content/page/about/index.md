I am Shreyas Ragavan. 

My passions typically revolve around severely flexing my creative and
analytical muscles in finding multi-disciplinary solutions to
problems. I enjoy trying to figure out how things work.

I started my career as a mechanical engineer and computational physicist
and my favorite subjects were Combustion, Aerodynamics and particularly
Computational Fluid Dynamics; and applying these subjects in the areas
of design engineering. Over time, my interests .. mutated and
diversified or gained a certain focus depending on your point of
view. My current areas of fascination lie in the applications of Data
Engineering and Machine Learning which I think tie in with my
fascination of using 'computers' in a sophisticated manner to 'model
things'.

Along the way, I've worked in R&D, Manufacturing, Operations Research,
Sales and in Software Engineering. A few years ago, I took a leap of
faith, from India and landed on the East Coast, in Toronto (Canada) and
then made my way over to the other end, near Vancouver, British
Columbia.

My hobbies tend to lie in the directions of reading, writing and
drawing, and of course - the eternal quest to become a better
programmer. Nowadays, I'm also trying to 'live more', by experimenting
with 'interesting things' that exist outside a computer :)

I also love [Emacs](https://www.emacswiki.org)! and am currently one of
the many Admins for the [EmacsWiki](https://www.emacswiki.org).

The only social media platform that I am active on, is Linked in. I do
have accounts on Mastodon and Twitter, but I seem to never find the time
to look at them much.
