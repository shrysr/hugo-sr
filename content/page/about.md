I'm Shreyas Ragavan _(pronounced sh(ray)-us)_. I started out as a
mechanical engineer and computational physicist passionate about design
and computer aided engineering techniques (in particular Computational
Fluid Dynamics and allied topics like Aerodynamics, Combustion).

At my core - I excel in analysis and research, and I enjoy tinkering
with code with the goal of solving problems, saving time
(_ahem..beautiful_) that saves time and solves problems.

I've worked in a variety of industries (Manufacturing, Oil and Gas,
Software) and functions (R&D, Technical Sales, Development(software),
Data Analytics).


## Education {#education}


### Masters {#masters}

MSc(Engg) - Advanced Mechanical Engineering
[University of Leeds](https://leeds.ac.uk) (Leeds, UK)


### Bachelors {#bachelors}

Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) - AUtomotive Design Engineering


## Areas of Interest {#areas-of-interest}

-   Analytical Engineering (what does this mean)
-   Machine Learning
-   Computational Fluid Dynamics


## Social {#social}

-   Linked in  (reasonably active regularly)
-   Github (though I also use sr.ht for my code repositories)
-   Dev.to  (mostly for syndicating my RSS feeds)


## This website {#this-website}

-   Based on Hugo.
-   The source of almost all the content is maintained in Org mode
    documents and manipulated with Emacs.
    -   Articles and pages are exported using ox-hugo to create markdown,
        including the appropriate export of linked images. This makes it
        somewhat trivial to quickly update a document pertaining to a Data
        science project for example.
