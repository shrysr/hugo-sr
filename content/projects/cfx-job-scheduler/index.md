## Introduction {#introduction}

This is a Python script for a portable, scalable job scheduler with
multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX simulations. The script was designed
to be called every minute by an external scheduler program.

-   In the practical case, the free version of the software [System
    Scheduler](https://www.splinterware.com/products/scheduler.html) was used to deploy the script successfully, for over 3
    years, managing 2 computing clusters.

Once called, the program basically loops through pre designated folders
and lists .def files based on the _last modified_ date available in
Windows. The system interaction was via BAT  scripts created via the
Python code, as well as the python OS library. There are several
in-built flags to support priority, pausing a particular cluster,
logging data and troubleshooting.

The idea behind the project was to create a multi-platform job scheduler
for ANSYS CFX that has a balance between sophistication and ease of
deployment (and management). Typically job schedulers and load balancing
programs are relatively very sophisticated and complex to setup with
several pre-requisites and constraints. Such complexity dictates
expensive commercial support and licensing considerations.

## Problem Statement {#problem-statement}

A job scheduler or simulation management system was required to address
the following:

-   Optimum and continuous simulation solver license utilisation by all
    members of the team in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis,
-   Provision for dynamic or urgent priority jobs, as well as an interface
    to submit simulations or view job history.
-   Optimisation and management of workload of simulation jobs
    facilitating overall project management and planning.


## What the program accomplished {#what-the-program-accomplished}

-   Allowed users to submit simulations by simply placing the input files
    in a particular folder location, which also served as a particular
    priority basket.
-   Removed the need of creating manual scripts to submit multiple
    simulations and resolved inefficient license utilisation approaches.
-   Facilitated a optimised approach to certain design cases, thus
    resulting in a 75% reduction in simulation time
-   Enabled the use of consistent solver and memory utilisation parameters
    and settings, allowing efficient deployment and reducing
    inefficiencies due to errors.
-   Allowed optimal or perfect utilisation of available licensing scheme,
    resulting in a significant increase in team output and productivity.
